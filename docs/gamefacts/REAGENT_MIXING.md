# Reagent mixing

The eight-reagent preparation system and its 48 formulas are described here.
Spell effects belong to [Magic spells](MAGIC_SPELLS.md). Original assessments
refer to the inspected DOS-era material labelled 1.16, not an identified retail
executable. Random requests are written R(a,b); endpoint conventions do not
establish the unavailable external generator's distribution or evaluation order.

### MIX-0001

**Reagent encoding and complete recipe catalog**

**Kind:** rule
**Uses:** INV-0001
**Original:** Established
**Redux:** Matches

The original recipe byte uses high-bit-first inventory order. Redux represents
the same ingredient sets using enum-index bits, beginning with Ash at bit zero;
numeric Redux masks must not be compared directly to the original bytes.

Reagent labels use the full Redux display vocabulary. **Sulfurous Ash** is an
editorial expansion of original shop **Sulfur Ash**; **Nightshade** follows the
original one-word spelling. Original shop **Mandrake** and gathering **mandrake
root** identify the same ingredient, displayed as **Mandrake Root**. These label
choices do not change ingredient indexes, recipe masks or the scoped recipe match.

| Inventory index | Reagent | Abbreviation | Original bit |
|---:|---|---|---:|
| 0 | Sulfurous Ash | SA | 0x80 |
| 1 | Ginseng | GS | 0x40 |
| 2 | Garlic | GA | 0x20 |
| 3 | Spider Silk | SS | 0x10 |
| 4 | Blood Moss | BM | 0x08 |
| 5 | Black Pearl | BP | 0x04 |
| 6 | Nightshade | NS | 0x02 |
| 7 | Mandrake Root | MR | 0x01 |

Each selected ingredient costs one unit per requested mixture. Ingredient order
does not matter, but missing or extra types make an incorrect recipe.

The scoped Redux match is the logical ingredient sets, including In Quas Xen's
five ingredients without Nightshade. Native continuation normalizes persisted
known-recipe selections to that canonical set. The non-player Nox effect is not
a 49th mixable spell.

### MIX-0002

**Preparation, expenditure, and stock cap**

**Kind:** rule
**Uses:** MIX-0001, INV-0005
**Original:** Established
**Redux:** Matches

Mix is admitted outdoors, in towns, and in dungeons; tactical combat rejects it
and reprompts the same actor. The original sequence is:

1. Sum the eight reagent stocks; zero stock stops before spell input.
2. Enter a spell. Empty/cancelled input stops. Invalid nonempty syllables retain
   an invalid spell sentinel and still permit the experiment.
3. Show only owned reagent types; manually toggle types, accept with M, or abort
   with Escape. There is no automatic formula selection.
4. Request at most two quantity digits. Zero cancels; insufficient stock for any
   selected type repeats the quantity prompt.
5. A zero ingredient mask changes nothing. Otherwise perform ten update ticks
   on surface maps, or ten wait ticks in the dungeon path, then subtract the
   entire requested amount from every selected type.
6. Only now check validity and exact recipe equality. Success adds the requested
   amount and caps prepared stock at 99; failure triggers MIX-0003 without refund.

For example, preparing five correct mixtures when 97 already exist consumes
five of every selected ingredient but adds only two charges. The cap follows
deduction. Redux's authoritative mixing operation preserves this cost/cap order
and validates stock and a nonzero eight-bit selection before mutation. The
match is this operation, not the original input/presentation lifecycle.

### MIX-0003

**Failed experiment and primary-target uncertainty**

**Kind:** rule
**Uses:** RNG-0001, ENV-0001
**Original:** Incomplete
**Redux:** Known discrepancy

An invalid spell or incorrect recipe spends the ingredients, then selects a
failure trap. The noncombat trap selector has eight outcomes: three Acid, two
Poison, two Bomb, and one Gas. Those are weights, not proof of a uniform external
random generator; 3/8, 2/8, 2/8, and 1/8 are conditional probabilities only.

| Trap | Effect |
|---|---|
| Acid | One transformed d30 of damage to the primary member. |
| Poison | Poison the primary member. |
| Bomb | Separate R(1,8) damage to each active non-Dead member. |
| Gas | Invoke poisoning across all six party slots. |

The original primary-target search accepts the first Good or Poisoned active
member. Sleeping is not eligible. If none exists, the search leaves a global
target index unchanged; the caller ignores failure and still executes the trap.
Acid/Poison can therefore use stale state. This is not a safe, specified fallback.

Redux selects the same first eligible member when one exists, and uses the
transformed d30 for Acid. With no eligible member it returns before trap selection
or effect, avoiding the stale-index path. This is a concrete difference; the
scoped normal-case match must not be expanded to the all-sleeping/dead edge case.
Bomb/Gas retain their separate party-sweep logic when a trap is executed.

### MIX-0004

**Redux formula knowledge and preparation interface**

**Kind:** rule
**Uses:** MIX-0001, MIX-0002
**Original:** Established
**Redux:** Intentional deviation

The original Mix interaction stores no learned-recipe state and never fills in
ingredients. Redux persists formula knowledge and can select known ingredients
to reduce repeated manual entry while retaining experimentation and its costs.
Book-of-Lore formulas are available in all three spell views; learned hidden
spells retain confirmed/uncertain knowledge. An undiscovered recipe is not exposed
merely by browsing. Successful experimentation confirms knowledge.

New-game templates do not infer taught formulas from prepared stock. Legacy
progressed-save imports retain their knowledge inference. Grendel and Lord Stuart
discoveries use their semantic formula boundaries; Chronicle projects their
persisted knowledge source/date rather than storing duplicate discovery events.

The spell finder accepts canonical syllable initials and name/effect search, with
All known, Prepared, and Mixable filters. Mixable requires a confirmed formula,
sufficient ingredients, and room for another charge. Manual mixing still permits
the full-cost cap behavior. Exact abbreviations precede longer prefixes: In Zu
wins over In Zu Grav. Ctrl+M from Cast or Z-stats opens preparation for the selected
spell; Ctrl+B returns to browsing.

Preparation defaults to one and Escape cancels, replacing the original zero-to-
cancel quantity prompt. For maxima 1–9 a valid digit replaces the quantity;
otherwise two digits are accepted and a third starts a new number. Over-limit
digits are rejected, not clamped. Backspace/Delete reset to one without modifying
spell syllables; a zero maximum prevents commitment. These are input conveniences,
not discounts for incorrect recipes.

Successful feedback retains the success indication and adds a receipt containing
spell, actual charges added, final stock, and discarded excess; one success sound
follows creation. Failure presents the actual trap without an extra fizzle prefix.
No-stock entry is reported before opening preparation.
